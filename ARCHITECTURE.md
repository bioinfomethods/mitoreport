# MitoReport Architecture

MitoReport itself is a command line application that requires only Java to run. It takes
VCF files and BAM files as input and writes out an HTML report that can be loaded in a
browser or distributed on a web server for users to access.

The diagram below shows the overall architecture of MitoReport and how
external components and systems interact with it.
